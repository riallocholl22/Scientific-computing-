## Compiled vs Interpreted Languages

**Compiled Languages:**  
These languages are translated entirely into machine code before execution.  
Examples: C, C++

**Interpreted Languages:**  
These are executed line-by-line at runtime.  
Examples: JavaScript, Python

**Python** is an interpreted language, executed using an interpreter like CPython,  
which makes it suitable for scripting and data analysis.
